# OBJ2BREP Algorithm<br />
This is a algorithm to transform Mesh-type geometry to Boundary Representation geometry.<br />
The algorithm is composed of four sub-process, namely, parser, classifier, filiter, and arranger.<br />
With this algorithm, the test 3D spatial data can be simplified at 60% format size. <br />
